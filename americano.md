This type of coffee has its origins in the Second World War when Italian baristas were trying to imitate the shape and taste of the so-called filter coffee that soldiers from the United States used to drink.

It is the typical espresso coffee where water is added to make it softer. Many people prefer to drink it with milk. You can add cream and sugar, but connoisseurs say that the idea is to keep the amount of milk or cream to a minimum to appreciate its taste much more.
