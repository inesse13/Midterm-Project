It is said that this coffee drink, which began to become popular in Italy in the mid-1990s, took its name due to the color of the habit of Capuchin monks.

An authentic cappuccino is a **combination of espresso, steamed milk, and milk foam** in equal parts. Characterized by the sweetness of its flavor, it has become a classic of coffee bars. It is widespread to sprinkle cocoa powder, grate black chocolate and make latte art figures on the foam to make coffee more attractive.

In recent times, **designs made by expert baristas have been popularized** around the world and America by accurately pouring steamed milk into espresso coffee.

The foamed milk is added so that three layers are distinguished in the cup: espresso, milk and milk cream (microfoam). The idea is that, when the client takes the cappuccino, he can taste the balance between the taste of coffee and the sweetness of the milk. In the best case, when a cappuccino is taken, it has a silky and enveloping texture resembling a dessert.

Cappuccino is an *excellent* example of how a drink changes by adapting to local tastes as it can be served in a cup or a glass cup with a handle depending on the place.
