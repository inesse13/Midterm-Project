## Macchiato

Another favorite that varies, depending on the barista and the place, is the macchiato. This term means spotted, and it comes from Italy. Originally, it is the combination between an espresso with milk stain with foam. It is much appreciated by those who want an espresso with a softer flavor and an even creamier texture.

The most common method is to combine espresso, caramel and milk foam or steamed milk, adding vanilla to add an extra flavor. Also, head to [“How to Make the Perfect Espresso”](https://www.coffeesesh.com/how-to-make-the-perfect-espresso/) to find out first how to make a cup of espresso.

This type of drink was born in the 16th century, and it is a coffee that is prepared in layers, and for this reason, is always served in a glass or transparent glass so that they become visible since it is its main attraction.

It is served in a medium porcelain cup or glass, “stained” with a little hot milk, sometimes a little foamy, but never at the level of the cappuccino.

We can find it in various versions:

* Espresso macchiato

* Latte macchiato

* Almond latte macchiato
